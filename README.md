Credit Risk Modelling

Project Overview:
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults within a two-year timeframe. The model is designed to assist financial institutions in assessing credit risk and making informed lending decisions.

Key Features:

High-Performance Model: Achieved an AUC score of 0.76, indicating strong predictive capability.
Feature Transformation: Implemented techniques to enhance model accuracy and robustness.
Large-Scale Predictions: Generated risk predictions for over 100,000 loan applications.
Data Visualization: Utilized advanced visualization and statistical analysis to identify key risk factors.
Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python 2.7
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis
